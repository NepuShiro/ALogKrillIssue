# ALogKrillIssue

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that exists to send logs to a seperate Console Window.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [ALogSender.dll](https://github.com/NepuShiro/ALogKrillIssue/releases/latest/download/ALogSender.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the [ALogViewer.exe](https://github.com/NepuShiro/ALogKrillIssue/releases/latest/download/ALogViewer.exe) to start the UDP Client for the Logging to be sent to. 
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs or the Console Window.
